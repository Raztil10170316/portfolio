<h3 class="moses1">-MOSES was first introduced to us as a baby floating in the Nile River. After being placed in a basket and put on to the Nile, he was spotted by the Pharaoh's daughter and rescued. He lived as a prince in Egypt and befriended 7 women who were being bullied by shepherds. One day, he received a call from God, who told him about the people who were suffering and how he wanted to bring them to "a land of milk and honey". God wanted MOSES to let his people go, but at the same time, he was going to harden the Pharaoh's heart.
    MOSES was a great prophet chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt. He encountered many hardships, such as the EGYPTIAN ARMIES and the RED SEA, but was always followed by God. When they finally reached the promised land, many of the people were not able to enter due to the sins they had created. MOSES had broken a rock in order to get water, much to God's dismay. He was given the hard task of persuading the Pharaoh to let the Israelites go.</h3>
